# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: sample application using Rails 4

This is the sample application for the 
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial*](http://railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/).

## Notes:

I've already done this tutorial, but I want to focus on a few specific things:
* Develop an app using updated tutorial for Rails 4 and Ruby 2.
* Practice better git usage.
* Understand details I missed when I was very new to Rails.
